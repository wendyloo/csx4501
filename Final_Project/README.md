# Survival Analysis: Acute-on-Chronic Kidney Disease in Cats
### Final Project for UCLAX CSX4501

In this project, we analyze data relating to acute-on-chronic kidney disease (ACKD) in cats. We use exploratory data analysis to identify biological and environmental variables that are correlated or anti-correlated with survival times, build machine learning classifier models to predict survival at 100 days and 500 days after an acute kidney failure event, and test and compare model performance for 3 trained classifers. On test sets, the logistic regression classifier achieved on average 74% accuracy in predicting survival at 100 days and 80% accuracy in predicting survival at 500 days, and outperformed the histogram gradient boosting and support vector classifiers.
